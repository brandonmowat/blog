Today was one of the hardest days I've ever had to deal with — I said goodbye to my best friend, Chloe.
She was the most excited, affectionate, and loyal dog that I've ever had the pleasure of being with.

There's something particularly tragic about a pet companion passing away.
They're entirely innocent and their love is unconditional.
They can truly do no wrong.

My family adopted Chloe February 14, 2005. We went to the breeders house early that morning. It was cold and snow covered the ground. My mom, dad, sister, brother, and myself were all in the car.
We only had one thing with us: a cheap, navy blue dog bed. It's a thin mat with a sort of frame around the edges of its circular shape.

When we got there, we were placed in a space surrounded by gates designed for children.
There were chocolate lab puppies bouncing around and falling all over each other.
I find you can always tell that a dog is in its infant stages, regardless of it's size, is that young dogs are still sort of clumsy. They were all clumsy.
The children were tasked with deciding which one we wanted to take home. How is anyone, let alone a child, supposed to make this kind of decision.
I think it may have been overwhelming to me at the time because I ended up sitting over to the side, up against the gate, watching my brother and sister play with the 2 month old puppies.

They were all the same to me — all were cute and varied slightly, but otherwise all equal. I sat watching, waiting for my siblings to choose for the three of us. Then one of the pups waddled over to me, sleepy and looking for a warm spot to fall asleep. My legs were crossed and she crawled into my lap, curled up and I pet her until she fell asleep.
My mind was made up. She took the burden off my shoulders.

She chose us.

I could go on and on about all the fond memories I have of her. Throwing a stick as far as humanly possible, watching her calculate where it was going to fall as she sprinted towards that exact spot. Seeing her paws dangling over the edge of the deck at the cottage as she watched over the family; she was our protector. Having her help open presents on Christmas morning.

Although sometimes they may annoy you, whine, bark, meow, hell they even shit on your nice carpet (and it's never the same after).
And despite all these things, you see them as the pinnacle of perfection. 
You compare their love to that of a pertner; which ends up being unfair to your partner, because at the end of the day, you know who you're going to choose over the other.

I keep wondering how I could ever have another dog in my life. How could any dog ever compare to the experience I had with Chloe? Maybe it's more of a rhetorical question.
Maybe the answer is that all the other experiences will be entirely independent of each other. Right now it doesn't feel that way.
