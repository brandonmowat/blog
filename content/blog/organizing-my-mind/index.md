One of the main reasons I built this blog was because I felt overwhelmed and scatterbrained. I found myself defaulting to scrolling through Instagram, procrastinating, and not giving the people I love the attention that they deserve. The work I was producing felt sub-par and I knew that I was capable of more -- I needed to re-learn how to focus.

Some first steps that I took was to get on a more regular sleep schedule and actively spend less time on my phone. These were things that were intuitive but I still felt like I was missing the guidance of an expert on the topic. Then on a Sunday afternoon in November, while browsing the non-fiction section of a book store with a few friends, the cover of [The Organized Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693669-the-organized-mind) jumped out at me.

I've since finished the book and found it incredibly helpful in both my personal life and professional life. Throughout my reading I took notes on things that felt particularly applicable to my situation. I'd like to share some of my learnings and maybe help you be able to "think straight" when so many people and things are calling for our attention.

### Some Background Knowledge

Daniel Levitin references 2 modes of thinking throughout the book: _Central Executive Mode_ and _Daydreaming Mode_. The central exectutive can be thought of as the CEO of your brain, actively engaging in the task at hand and thinking critically. We think linearly in this mode and, as long as we can stay focused, we may eve be able to enter a state of **Flow** (more on that later). If you're familiar with the brain, you already know that this mode is driven by the Prefrontal Cortex. For more abstract thinking, we engage our brains daydreaming mode. Daydreaming is what many of the greatest minds find their most brilliant ideas; it's where we find ourselves making connections between ideas that seem unrelated because we allow our mind to wander in ways we can't when we're focused on collecting information and thinking critically.

Neither one of these modes is better than the other, but it's important that we understand their significance. We can use them as tools by creating environments or making time for willing ourselves into thinking critically or allowing ourselves to daydream.

### So many things to do, such little time

Each and every day, there are an overwhelming number of things that we need to remember to do; locking the door, feeding our pet, picking up a gift for a friends upcoming birthday, ensuring work meetings are effective and that you're not wasting everyones time, [_"I could go on forever baby"._](https://www.moviequotedb.com/movies/home-alone-2-lost-in-new-york/ratings.html) And that's just you! Imagine all of the things that someone like Sheryl Sandberg or Bill Gates have to remember to do. How do they stay on task and get to where they need to be when normal people, like you and I, forget about commitments we made a week ago and lose valuable belongings on a semi-regular basis?

Organizing one's own responsibilities and priorities can feel like a full-time job; and for some it is. Highly Successful Persons (as Daniel Levitin likes to call them) typically have executive assistants to handle these day-to-day organizational tasks. This is how they're able to give the person, or people, that they're engaged with at any given moment, their full and undivided attention -- all while being able to get deep work done, creative endeavours, and make it to their next meeting on time. However, it's not just scheduling that needs to be done. These assistants may also act as a filter for inbound communication as well, allowing for only the most important and immediate things to attract their attention.

The list of organizational optimizations that could be made for you could be endless... But the vast majority of us do not have the luxury of having full-time help. How can we do it all on our own? Could we somehow **externalize** these responsibilities so that we _don't_ have to constantly remember? Unsurprisingly, the easy answer is yes!

### Allowing for Deep Focus

The way to get to deep focus is to minimize the amount of things you need to remember or do at any particular time; this requires organizing both your time and environment. Accomplishing both of these things will help you in entering deep focus by being free to engage your prefrontal cortex (Central Executive) and entering daydreaming mode without distraction. One of the greatest adversaries of an organized mind is the _Rehearsal Loop_.

Before pen and paper there was no way to externalize an idea or thought, our brains developed in such a way that it would remind itself of something it didn't want to forget because creating a permamnt memory for it would be a waste of resources;  we call this the Rehearsal Loop. Our brains have to pick and choose what things are committed to memory -- this is reserved mostly for emotionally connected events, as well as knowledge acquired while focused intently on a task followed by engaging our daydreaming mode (this takes time). Being caught inside this loop uses precious resources that would be better applied to focusing on a paper you're writing or on a friend that's offering you their time. Externalizing our memory to the physical or digital world breaks us out of the loop and allows us to get back to what's important. This can be as simple as carrying a small notebook around and jotting down these small things that pop into your head that may or may not need action, or even adding an event to your calendar (digital or analog). Let me provide an example:

> Suppose you remember that your friend Lake's birthday is coming up -- instead of saying to yourself "I'll remember that", you should immediately put it in your calendar. That way you will be reminded that it is their birthday on the day of or will see it coming up as it approaches and you no longer are tasked to _rememeber_, you're free to go about your life knowing that the details exist where you need them when you need them. 

> Following this example, suppose that between externalizing this memory and the day of their birthday, they mention something that brings up the idea to get them something specific as a gift on their birthday. Since you're a person with an organized mind you know exactly what to do; you open up the externalized memory (i.e. calendar event, note) and add the relevant information. If you're as organized as an executive assistant to the CEO of a fortune 500 company, maybe you even create another calendar event, 1 week from the birthday event, to gather the gift.

Externalizing your memory allows you to "remember" things that you would otherwise forget and allow you to focus on the things that are most immediate and highest priority, regardless of whether it's work or friends.

#### Time & Environment

Time is a precious resource. It's finite and cannot be created _(some may argue that diet and exercise can prolong you life, but maybe that's an essay for another blog post)_ so it must be used effectively and organized well. As explored in the previous section, we can organize our time better by being vigilent about scheduling events and reminders for ourselves. Organizing your time isn't just about scheduling errands or meetings; it's about scheduling personal time, time for deep work without distraction, time for catching up on email, and time for daydreaming.

Organizing your environment is also key to entering a state of deep focus. We can apply the concept of [Gibsonian Affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) to relieve us of the burden of having to remember where things are and to help us from forgetting where our belongings are. An example of an affordance in the home is a keyhook or bowl near your front door. However, one of the rules of Gibsonain Affordances is that you never deviate from it. If you stray from the rule, then the affordance no longer works -- you'll end up in a case where you go to the place where "you always put them" and they're not there. Organizing your environment doesn't just apply to your home though, it applies to work as well
