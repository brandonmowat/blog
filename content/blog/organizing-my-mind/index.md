One of the main reasons I built this blog was because I felt overwhelmed and scatterbrained. I found myself defaulting to scrolling through Instagram, procrastinating, and not giving the people I love the attention that they deserve. The work I was producing felt sub-par and I knew that I was capable of more -- I needed to re-learn how to focus.

Some first steps that I took was to get on a more regular sleep schedule and actively spend less time on my phone. These were things that were intuitive but I still felt like I was missing the guidance of an expert on the topic. Then on a Sunday afternoon in November, while browsing the non-fiction section of a book store with a few friends, the cover of [The Organized Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693669-the-organized-mind) jumped out at me.

I've since finished the book and found it incredibly helpful in both my personal life and professional life. Throughout my reading I took notes on things that felt particularly applicable to my situation. I'd like to share some of my learnings and maybe help you be able to "think straight" when so many people and things are calling for our attention.

### Some Background Knowledge

Daniel Levitin references 2 modes of thinking throughout the book: _Central Executive Mode_ and _Daydreaming Mode_. The central exectutive can be thought of as the CEO of your brain, actively engaging in the task at hand and thinking critically. We think linearly in this mode and, as long as we can stay focused, we may eve be able to enter a state of **Flow** (more on that later). If you're familiar with the brain, you already know that this mode is driven by the Prefrontal Cortex. For more abstract thinking, we engage our brains daydreaming mode. Daydreaming is what many of the greatest minds find their most brilliant ideas; it's where we find ourselves making connections between ideas that seem unrelated because we allow our mind to wander in ways we can't when we're focused on collecting information and thinking critically.

Neither one of these modes is better than the other, but it's important that we understand their significance. We can use them as tools by creating environments or making time for willing ourselves into thinking critically or allowing ourselves to daydream.

### Allowing for Deep Focus

Each and every day, there are an overwhelming number of things that we need to remember to do; locking the door, feeding our pet, picking up a gift for a friends upcoming birthday, ensuring work meetings are effective and that you're not wasting everyones time, [_"I could go on forever baby"._](https://www.moviequotedb.com/movies/home-alone-2-lost-in-new-york/ratings.html) And that's just you! Imagine all of the things that someone like Sheryl Sandberg or Bill Gates have to remember to do. How do they stay on task and get to where they need to be when normal people, like you and I, forget about commitments we made a week ago and lose valuable belongings on a semi-regular basis?

For one, highly successful persons (as Daniel Levitin likes to call them) typically have executive assistants. These people
