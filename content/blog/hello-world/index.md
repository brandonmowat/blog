Welcome to Matcha & Mochi -- a place for me to share some deeper thoughts.

I've spun up this blog as a small experiment. More recently, I've been feeling like I need a better place to share more longform ideas, thoughts, experiences, and anything else. A blog/website seemed like the best idea as one of the important criteria for me was to have control over the user experience.

One thing that I've been doing recently is bullet journaling so the process of writing things down has become more prevelant in my day-to-day. Blogging, if I may call it that, seems like a natural progression. Plus, having the opportunity to build it myself gives me a place to make my own design decisions as well as try out some new technical tools that I don't get to in my regular work hours.

> Where does the name come from?

I have this weekend ritual: Every Saturday and/or Sunday morning I go to this cafe called [Neo Coffee Bar](http://www.neocoffeebar.com/). It's this very comfortable, well designed establishment with some of the best coffee and pastries _(All of which are made on-site)_ in Toronto. However, only on weekends do they make [Daifuku Mochi](https://www.google.com/search?q=daifuku+mochi). It must be one of my favourite treats ever since I first had it. I've gotten a little off track but I usually order it alongside a matcha latte and when people ask what I'm doing those mornings, I tell them _I'm having Matcha and Mochi at Neo_.
