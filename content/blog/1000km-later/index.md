Most people that I talk to hate running; I know I did a few years ago when i started. I tell those people this: "No one gets up one day and decides they love to run -- it's like wine, beer, and coffee; it's an acquired taste." It's something that you grow into, or rather grows onto you. It becomes something that you look forward to and gives you energy rather than depleting it.

When I started running regularly, in March of 2018, I had no end goal -- nothing i was working towards. I wasn't trying to get in shape or prove anything to anyone; in a sense, I think I was metaphorically running away from something. That year was full of challenging situations that I had never had experience dealing with and didn't have any idea of how to cope with emotional challenges of that caliber. I wasn't seeing a therapist and didn't know how to talk to friends or family about my anxieties. 
â€¨As time went on and as things slowly got worse for me, I ended up running further and further. I pushed myself harder out of necessity, all of which happened subconsciously and by accident. There was more on my mind than ever before so I spent more and more of my spare time running.

A year and a half later I ran my first full marathon, and today I passed the 1000km mark. I've learned a lot about myself while running along the Toronto waterfront. I no longer struggle with the same issues that I did when I started and running was a big reason I was able to get through that time in my life. Running became the way that managed my emotions and worked through my problems. It was time on my own to think, reflect, plan, dream, and distance myself from the bad stuff.
